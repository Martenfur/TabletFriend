# This is a layout file. It defines what buttons do, how they look and how they are arranged. 
# This may look a bit overwhelming at first, but you can remove any properties that you don't 
# need and everything will work just fine. For example, you can remove all theme properties 
# and simply use external themes.
# You can also hot-reload the layouts and immediately preview your changes. 
# Simply edit and save the layout, and the app will immediately display your changes.

# Indentations DO matter, they determine the property hierarchy.

# Max layout width measured in cells. The buttons do not have position properties - instead, they get stacked automatically
# from left to right and from top to bottom. Layout width specifies how far left the buttons can be stacked.
